			<h7>Bleeding oral tissues are putting people at risk for a serious health crisis.</h7>
			<p>Jan 2018 - Tufts University- Journal of the National Cancer Institute<br>
				<br>In the largest study of its kind, over 7000 medically at risk patients were evaluated for 'gums that bleed' and the incidence of cancer. Smoking was taken into account as results were considered. In general these patients had a 25% increased CA rate. Specifically, the incidence of lung and colon CA more than doubled. If patients had lost teeth, the rate of colon CA went up to 80%.<br>
				<br>The study could not conclude that oral pathogens were causal to the CA, but were found responsible for the increased risk.<br>
				<br>YOU... are at risk if you are 45 to 50 YO, have any ongoing chronic disease, have a genetically at-risk background, and have gums that seem to bleed... even a little.<br>
				<br>Lets keep it simple... saliva is full of oral bacteria, both good and bad. A patient swallows 1000's of times a day. The bacteria have easy access to the colon. The bacteria do the same thing to the colon lining as they do to the gums... they destroy cells and cause bleeding. A two-fold increase in colon CA rate has been reported.<br>
				<br>Lets keep it simple again... patients snore or breathe harder at night as they age. It is more difficult to get adequate oxygen. The dramatically increased pressure created by 'snoring'... sucks down a host of oral pathogens. They have found a new home. They do the same damage in the lung as they do in the mouth. A two-fold incidence in lung CA rate has been reported.<br>
				<br>A simple salivary test for high-risk patients is available to determine if they have a potentially high level of bad bacteria. Dental teams can provide this service. Does yours... or are you at risk?<br>
				<br>YOUR wellness matters. To our patient friends, ask your dental team to test for these pathogens if you think there is an ongoing risk. To our oral systemic colleagues, your patients are blessed and thanks for making a difference!</p>

			<h7>Cardiovascular health is not possible for high-risk patients without dental supervision of oral pathogens.</h7>
							<p>Jan 2018- Dr Amy Doneen case presentaion to Bale/Doneen physicians and dentists. Note; the Bale/Doneen method of cardiovascular health guarantees patients under that philosophy of care... will never have a heart attack or stroke...never.<br>
							<br>A 45 YO male experiencing a recent heart attack reported for a cardiovascular consultation. In short, normal weight, average BP, above average exercise, and dentist stated no signs of periodontal disease or bleeding on probing. Blood work for inflammatory markers showed high hsCRP, LaPLAC2, and myeloperoxidase. Carotid intima-media thickness was elevated 10 years beyond his age. Patient was positive for 'the wrong genes' and had a genetic family HX of CVD.<br>
							<br>Minor adjustments were made for 2 medications and no lifestyle changes were required. The same 4 inflammatory markers remained high- the patient remained at risk for another HA.<br>
							<br>Dr Doneen called the dentist and insisted a salivary DNA based pathogen test be done... even if it did not appear logical. The saliva test was taken, and several high risk pathogens were found present. They were treated and mitigated with antibiotics and antimicrobials.<br>
							<br>In 3 months, by solely mitigating oral high-risk pathogens, all blood inflammatory markers were normal and the carotid intima- media thickness returned to a healthy status.<br>
							<br>Again- cardiovascular health is not possible for high-risk patients without dental supervision of oral pathogens.<br>
							<br>To our patient friends - ask your dental team to commit to this new standard of care. <br>To our oral systemic colleagues - your patients are blessed! </p>

			<h7>This year give the passion of LIFE!</h7><p>A new year is just around the corner... friends and family will again face the reality of the impact of chronic disease in America.<br>
				<br>Yes, oral pathogens are now irrefutably connected to atherosclerotic disease, human disabilities, and even death... that is only a piece of the puzzle as it relates to human health.<br>
				<br>The more we eat... the sooner we die. The less we eat... the longer we live. More sugars mean more inflammation. More inflammation means shorter life spans. Increased exersise reduces systemic inflamation and extends wellness at every level.<br>
				<br>Nutrition, moderation, and movement... trump medication and treatment everyday.<br>
				<br>So easy to 'say' lets make better lifestyle choices... difficult to accomplish. May healthcare be relentless in encouraging our patients to embrace life extending practices.<br>

			<img src="../images/clearbox.png" alt=""><br>
			<h7>It is common practice for infections or disease to be confirmed with a test, except dental disease.  Why?</h7>
				<p>Gums that bleed, even a little, in high-risk patients, are a medical problem with a dental solution...by a trained team.<br>
				<br>High-risk oral pathogens cause gums to bleed. They also initate bleeding on artery walls. That of course is potentially more serious.<br>
				<br>Medicine uses tests to identify the exact identity of bacteria that may be causing systemic infectious diseases. Like meningitis, like pneumonia, like lyme disease... and so many more.<br>
				<br>A test result offers medicine an accutate treatment protocol. A diagnostic test is a standard of care.<br>
				<br>This is an actual test available to all high-risk dental patients to determine their risk of any ongoing oral infection that may be translocated to any other part of the body.<br>
				<br>This type of test should be the standard of care for our high-risk patients. Patients must advocate for this higher standard! Ask.<br>

A person who is medically or genetically compromised. A person not able to effectively 'fight' systemic bacteria.<br>
			<br>The colored columns over the black lines... are not good. These pathogens are over safe or healthy tolerances and capable of leaving the mouth. The body's natural defense system is not working efficiently any more.<br>
			<br>For most of us, this can start at age 45 to 50.<br>
			<br>Four of the pathogens in this test result have been found to CAUSE athersclerotic disease and found to be directly associated with 50% of the heart attacks and strokes pateints incur.<br>
			<br>This patient had a heart attack 12 months ago... a 50% chance it was initiated by one of the pathogens in his saliva test.<br>
			<br>This test not only shows exactly what bad 'bugs' are in his mouth... they are a profile depicting the bad 'bugs' that are translocating to his coronary, corodtid, and femoral arteries.<br>
			<br>Some medical and dental insures are now covering this simple test. More will soon. A majority of patients want to pay for this service ... regardless.<br>
			<br>Routine brushing, flossing, and traditional dental cleanings... do not kill these pathogens.<br>
