				<h7>Be a solution to your patients.</h7>
					<p>2017 - 92.1 million Americans have some form of heart disease - American Heart Association</p>
					<p>2004- J Periodontology - 91% of people with heart disease have some form of gums that bleed</p>
					<p>2018- 83.5 million Americans have both heart disease and gums that bleed</p>
					<p>2017- the 'Anerobe' co-occurrence study - the same profile of high-risk, gram negative, pathogens found in the mouth are found on coronary and carotid arteries of patents who have some form of both heart disease and gums that bleed. That is 83.5M Americans.<br>
					<p>The past decade- a vascular researcher, Pessi, has found 50% or more of heart attacks and strokes are initiated by, linked to, associated with, and some simply caused by... oral pathogens living on arterial linings. That will be 50% of 83.5M Americans.<br></p>
					<p>'Houston... we have a problem! '<br></p>
					<p>The 'bad bugs' in the human mouth or those which have moved to the coronary and carotid arteries do not need to be a risk factor for 83.5M Americans. Trained dental teams have the solution ... some medical teams are referring patients to these teams. This is 'new'... but vitally important to patient wellness and reducing chronic disease.<br></p>
					<p>To our patient friends... encourage your dental team to move in this direction. To our oral systemic colleagues... your patients are living longer!<br></p>
					<p>'Houston... we have a solution!'</p>

				<h7>A simple saliva test can tell you, and your patients, which dangerous bacteria have infected their body.</h7>
					<p>The evidence is irrefutable. When certain high risk pathogens are found in patients who have gums that bleed 'a little'... those same pathogens are consistently found in the arteries of the same patient who also has high blood pressure... or any other symptom of cardiovascular disease.<br>
					<br>It is not coinciental that 91% of pateints with cardiovascular symptoms, have gums that bleed... even 'a little'. It is not coincidental that over 50% of HAs and strokes are associated with, linked to, or directly caused by... an oral pathogen.<br>
					<br>Dentistry is poised to be a difference maker. Dentistry has a simple salivary test that identifies these high risk microbes.<br>
					<br>Dentistry can specifically target them once identified.<br>
					<br>There is a new standard of care available. To our patient friends... insist on it. <br>To our oral systemic colleagues... your patients are blessed!</p>

					<p>Reuters, Aug 2017- 
					<br>People who have gums that bleed 'a little', same as chronic inflammation... 
					<br>for 10 years or more are 70 percent <u>more likely</u> to develop Alzheimer's disease.<br>
					<br>The oral pathogen Td has been linked to this disease process.<br>

				<h7>Vascular health improved by oral health</h7>
					<p>An eight year study of almost 600 high-risk patients was conducted to see if cardiovascular disease outcomes could be improved.<br>
					<br>The study participants had to take a simple salivary test to find high-risk pathogens. Just like the one seen here. If they had any of these 'bad bugs' ... they were targeted and eliminated as part of the study protocol.<br>
					<br>The participants were also asked to make other lifestyle changes.<br>
					<br>When oral bacteria were 'killed'... they found vascular health improved very quickly.<br>
					<br>The pathogens in the mouth were found living along artery walls and doing damage.<br>
					<br>At the end of 8 years, there were significantly less cardiovascular events than a 'norm' population and vascular health was greatly enhanced when viewed by CMIT imaging.<br>
					<br>The standard of care for all at risk patients: a simple salivary test by a trained dental team. To our patient friends- ask your dental team for this test if you are concerned about your heart health. To our oral systemic colleagues- your patients are blessed!<br>
					<br>Spread the word friends, heart attacks have been the #1 killer of Americans for 100 years. Dentists have been cleaning teeth about the same way for the same 100 years... its time for a new standard!</p>

			<li class="four_sixth"><h7>Profile what you are fighting</h7>
				<p>This is an actual pathogen test given by a dental team to a high-risk patient. A person who is medically or genetically compromised. A person not able to effectively 'fight' systemic bacteria.<br>
				<br>The colored columns over the black lines... are not good. These pathogens are over safe or healthy tolerances and capable of leaving the mouth. The body's natural defense system is not working efficiently any more.<br>
				<br>For most of us, this can start at age 45 to 50.<br>
				<br>Four of the pathogens in this test result have been found to CAUSE athersclerotic disease and found to be directly associated with 50% of the heart attacks and strokes pateints incur.<br>
				<br>This patient had a heart attack 12 months ago... a 50% chance it was initiated by one of the pathogens in his saliva test.<br>
				<br>This test not only shows exactly what bad 'bugs' are in his mouth... they are a profile depicting the bad 'bugs' that are translocating to his coronary, corodtid, and femoral arteries.<br>
				<br>This patient, and all those we test, are extremely grateful to know this information... and be treated to have these organisms reduced! Patients care... that we care so much.<br>
				<br>Some medical and dental insures are now covering this simple test. More will soon. A majority of patients want to pay for this service ... regardless.<br>
				<br>Routine brushing, flossing, and traditional dental cleanings... do not kill these pathogens.<br>
				<br>To our patient friends... share this with your dental team... encourage them to raise the standard of care... for you! To our collegues already testing and treating for these pathogens... your patients are blessed! </p>

				<h7>Your Dental team choice matters</h7>
					<p>FACTS: 70% of patients who have a dental cleaning with some scaling... leave with a full systemic bacteremia.<br>
					<br>The incidence of a cardiovascular events double in the first 21 days after a cleaning appointment that includes scaling...  returns to normal after 6 months.<br>
					<br>CONCLUSION: It matters who cares for your 'gum' health and how your teeth are cleaned!</p>
